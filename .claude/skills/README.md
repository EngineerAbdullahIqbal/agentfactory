## CRITICAL COLLISION RESOLUTION

### 1. Content Quality Assessment: TWO TOOLS, DIFFERENT PURPOSES

**Skills**: `chapter-evaluator` + `content-evaluation-framework`

| Aspect      | chapter-evaluator                               | content-evaluation-framework  |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Purpose** | Diagnose specific problems                      | Gate decision (pass/fail)     |
| **When**    | During development (find issues)                | Before publication (go/no-go) |
| **Output**  | Detailed findings + improvement recommendations | Weighted score (75%+ = pass)  |
| **User**    | Authors (improving content)                     | Reviewers (publication gate)  |

**CORRECT WORKFLOW**:

```
Author develops lesson
  ↓
Author runs chapter-evaluator → "What's wrong with this?"
  ↓
Author identifies issues + uses remediation skills:
  - Low Clarity? → Use technical-clarity
  - Low Engagement? → Use exercise-pack
  - Low Scaffolding? → Use concept-scaffolding
  ↓
Author revises content
  ↓
Reviewer runs content-evaluation-framework → "Is this 75%+?"
  ↓
PASS → Publish | FAIL → Return to author with chapter-evaluator
```

**DO NOT**:

- Use chapter-evaluator as final gate (it's diagnostic, not pass/fail)
- Use content-evaluation-framework during development (doesn't identify what's wrong)
- Ask "which one?" — use BOTH in sequence

---

### 2. Teaching AI Collaboration: DESIGN FIRST, THEN CODE

**Skills**: `ai-collaborate-teaching` + `exercise-pack`

| Aspect       | ai-collaborate-teaching                                  | exercise-pack                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**  | Design lesson balance                                    | Generate specific examples                     |
| **Scope**    | Whole lesson structure                                   | Individual code examples                       |
| **Question** | "How should this lesson mix foundation/AI/verification?" | "What code example demonstrates this concept?" |
| **Output**   | 40/40/20 balance plan                                    | Runnable code with validation                  |

**CORRECT WORKFLOW**:

```
Lesson concept defined
  ↓
Use ai-collaborate-teaching → "Design the lesson balance"
  ↓
Lesson should be 40% foundation + 40% AI + 20% verification
  ↓
For EACH section needing code:
  Use exercise-pack → Generate specific examples
  (Examples must follow Spec→Prompt→Code→Validation)
  ↓
Assemble lesson with code examples fitting the 40/40/20 structure
```

**DO NOT**:

- Skip ai-collaborate-teaching and jump to code examples (no balance)
- Use exercise-pack randomly (examples must fit lesson design)

---

### 3. Learning Design: OBJECTIVES → SCAFFOLDING → CLARITY

**Skills**: `learning-objectives` + `concept-scaffolding` + `technical-clarity`

| Skill               | Question                      | Output                                        | When            |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| learning-objectives | "What will students DO?"      | SMART outcomes + Bloom's levels + assessments | PLAN (first)    |
| concept-scaffolding | "How will students LEARN it?" | 3-7 step progression + cognitive load limits  | DESIGN (second) |
| technical-clarity   | "Is this clear to read?"      | Prose refinement + jargon checks              | POLISH (third)  |

**CORRECT WORKFLOW**:

```
Step 1: Define learning objectives
  → What outcomes? (Bloom's Create level)
  → What proficiency? (CEFR B1)
  → How to assess? (Concrete evals)
  → Output: learning_objectives.md

Step 2: Design progression to reach objectives
  → How many steps? (3-7)
  → Concepts per step? (B1 = 3-5)
  → Validation checkpoints?
  → Output: scaffolding_plan.md

Step 3: Write lesson content following scaffolding
  → Use exercise-pack for worked examples
  → Use ai-collaborate-teaching for 40/40/20 balance
  → Output: lesson.md (draft)

Step 4: Polish clarity
  → Run technical-clarity skill
  → Fix: gatekeeping language, jargon, accessibility
  → Output: lesson.md (final)

Step 5: Verify against outcomes
  → Use chapter-evaluator
  → All objectives measurable? Learning outcomes clear?
  → Output: evaluation report
```

**DO NOT**:

- Write lesson first, define objectives after (backwards)
- Skip scaffolding design (jump straight to writing)
- Polish prose before content is solid (wrong priority)
